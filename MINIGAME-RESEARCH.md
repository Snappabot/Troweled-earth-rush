## 🍬 GAME 1: Candy Crush Saga
**Genre:** Match-3 Puzzle | **Publisher:** King (Activision Blizzard)  
**Key Stats:** 180M MAU, $1B/year, 3.6B+ lifetime downloads

### Why It's Addictive

#### Mechanic 1: Limited Lives + Wait Timer
You get 5 lives. Fail and you lose one. Run out — wait 30 minutes or pay. This creates **scarcity anxiety** — you play more carefully and come back obsessively when lives refill.

**TEM Adaptation: Spill Meter Lives System**
> The existing Spill Meter becomes a "job reputation" health bar. Each plastering job gives you 3–5 "rep stars." Mess up a job (spill too much, botch the troweling, scaffold collapse) and you lose a star. Hit zero stars = the crew knocks off early and you have to wait for Matt to calm down (15–30 min timer) OR spend Satoshis to get back on the tools. Matt sends you a furious WhatsApp-style speech bubble: *"Mate, I've had it. Take 20 minutes and think about what you've done."*

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 8/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

---

#### Mechanic 2: Level Objectives + "Almost" Psychology
Every level has a specific objective (clear the jellies, reach the score, collect ingredients). The **"just one more move"** feeling — losing by 1 move or 2 points — is scientifically engineered to keep you hooked.

**TEM Adaptation: Job Completion Star Ratings**
> Each plastering job is rated 1–3 stars based on: speed (finish before client timer runs out), quality (troweling accuracy score), and cleanliness (spill meter at end). You almost always land 2 stars, tempting you to replay. 3-star jobs pay premium Satoshis and unlock rare character outfits (Jose's leopard-print headband, Tsuyoshi's gold mohawk etc).

- **Difficulty to Build:** Easy  
- **Fun Factor:** 8/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

---

#### Mechanic 3: Boosters & Power-Ups (Scarce, Earned, or Bought)
Candy Crush gives you special candies (striped, wrapped, colour bomb) as rare rewards. These are **slot-machine dopamine hits** — you never know when one drops.

**TEM Adaptation: Power Tools as Boosters**
> The crew sometimes arrives at a job and "finds" a power tool in the van. Random daily drops: Tsuyoshi's Angle Grinder (doubles troweling speed), Fabio's Magic Hawk (perfect trowel trace, no drag penalty), Phil's Legendary Hawk (triple Satoshi earning on next job). These drop randomly or can be purchased. Speech bubble from Phil: *"Found this bad boy under a drop sheet."*

- **Difficulty to Build:** Easy  
- **Fun Factor:** 7/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

---

#### Mechanic 4: Episodic Map Progression
Candy Crush uses a winding road map divided into episodes. Each episode completion is celebrated. You're always moving forward, but the map stretches on forever — **infinite perceived progress**.

**TEM Adaptation: Melbourne Suburb Unlock Map**
> The TEM van starts restricted to the inner north (Fitzroy, Collingwood, Carlton). Complete enough jobs, earn enough Satoshis, and unlock new suburbs — Footscray, St Kilda, Dandenong, eventually the CBD high-rises and luxury Toorak apartments. Each suburb has its own job types, difficulty levels, and client personalities. The "Episode Complete" screen shows a TEM crew photo with speech bubbles: *"Dandenong! Bloody legend territory."*

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 9/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

---

#### Mechanic 5: Daily Rewards / Wheel Spin
Log in daily, spin a wheel or open a chest. Creates **habit loop** — daily ritual, always something to look forward to.

**TEM Adaptation: Connie's Daily Briefing + Scratch Ticket**
> Each morning Connie calls the crew in for a briefing (speech bubble or short animation). She reveals the Day's Special Job (bonus Satoshi multiplier) and hands out a "Site Lucky Dip" — scratch a virtual scratchie card styled as a lottery ticket. Prizes: Satoshis, power tools, or rare jobs. Mikayla pops up on screen to announce the result with thumbs up or sympathetic face.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Easy  
- **Fun Factor:** 8/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

## 🛹 GAME 2: Subway Surfers
**Genre:** Endless Runner | **Publisher:** SYBO Games / Kiloo  
**Key Stats:** 100M MAU, ~4B lifetime downloads, top 10 all-time mobile game

### Why It's Addictive

#### Mechanic 1: Endless High-Score Chasing
No finish line. Pure score chase. Every run is a personal challenge to beat your last score. **Competitive ego loop** — share score, someone beats you, you play again.

**TEM Adaptation: Van Chase Endless Mode**
> "Matt's Late Freight" mode — an endless driving mini-game where you're speeding the TEM van through Melbourne's CBD, running red lights and dodging trams while a furious client chases you for being late on a quote. Swipe lanes, dodge trams, leap over road works, collect Satoshi coins along the way. Multiplier grows the longer you survive. Global + friends leaderboard. Voice line from Matt: *"Don't stop, whatever you do, don't bloody stop."*

- **Difficulty to Build:** Hard  
- **Fun Factor:** 10/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 8/10

---

#### Mechanic 2: Character & Board Collection
Subway Surfers has dozens of unlockable characters and hoverboards. Collecting them is a major engagement loop — not for stats, but for **identity and completionism**.

**TEM Adaptation: Character & Van Skin Unlock System**
> Unlock all 9 TEM crew members as playable drivers, each with a special ability: Jose gets a "chill mode" that slows time, Tsuyoshi gets a turbo boost (mohawk flaps in the wind), Joe's hi-vis outfit attracts bonus Satoshis, Connie unlocks VIP jobs. Van skins: "The Ghost" (all-white stealth van), "Satoshi Cruiser" (gold BTC logo wrap), "Blue-Collar Baller" (racing livery). Cosmetic only — no pay-to-win — but deeply collectible.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 8/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

---

#### Mechanic 3: Weekly Hunt & Limited Events
Subway Surfers runs regular city-specific events and weekly hunts (collect X items for a reward). Creates **FOMO urgency** and brings lapsed players back.

**TEM Adaptation: Seasonal Melbourne Events**
> Monthly themed job rushes tied to real Melbourne events: "Grand Final Week" (AFL paint rush — decorate client houses in team colours before the siren), "Festival Season" (high-end St Kilda art installations), "Heatwave Jobs" (extra spill meter difficulty, bonus shade mechanic). Limited-time cosmetics (Jose's Christmas tinsel dreads, Tsuyoshi's NYE mohawk fireworks). Event leaderboard — top plastering crew wins exclusive van skin.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 9/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

---

#### Mechanic 4: Hoverboard Shield / Second Chance
Equipped hoverboards act as one-hit shields. If you crash, the hoverboard takes the hit, and you keep going. This **removes punishment anxiety** and makes players braver — leading to higher scores and longer sessions.

**TEM Adaptation: Insurance Run / Second Chance**
> "Phil's Insurance" mechanic — once per session, when you fail a job or crash the van, Phil magically appears and says *"Covered, mate"* (complete with wink). The job resets from the last checkpoint. Limited to once per session for free; spend Satoshis to activate more. Alternatively, having Joe in the crew unlocks "WorkCover Mode" — an extra fail-safe on scaffold jobs.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Easy  
- **Fun Factor:** 7/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

---

#### Mechanic 5: Score Multiplier Missions
Earn multipliers by completing small in-run missions (jump X times, collect X coins). Missions stack up a permanent multiplier score over time — a long-term **meta progression loop**.

**TEM Adaptation: Crew XP & Job Mastery**
> Each crew member levels up through repeated use. Jarrad unlocks "Precision Mode" at level 5. Fabio unlocks "Speed Plastering" at level 8. Levelling up characters increases their Satoshi multiplier for jobs they work on. Progress feels real and permanent — even short sessions contribute to the long-term build. Display a "Crew Today" screen before each job showing who's levelled up recently.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 8/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

## ⚔️ GAME 3: Clash of Clans
**Genre:** Strategy / Base Builder | **Publisher:** Supercell  
**Key Stats:** ~100M MAU, $500M+/year revenue, launched 2012, still top-10 grossing

### Why It's Addictive

#### Mechanic 1: Base Building with Wait Timers
Build your base, upgrade buildings — everything has a real-time wait (minutes to days). Creates **anticipation loops** and motivates returning to the game at specific times.

**TEM Adaptation: HQ Builder — The Depot**
> Build and upgrade the TEM Depot: start with a basic shed in Reservoir, upgrade to a proper workshop in Thornbury, eventually build the dream — a fully kitted-out multi-bay workshop in Collingwood with van wash, tool storage, and a break room with real coffee machine. Each upgrade takes real time (15 min → 4 hours → 12 hours for big upgrades). Connie and Mikayla appear in the depot animation. The better your depot, the faster you can accept premium jobs.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Hard  
- **Fun Factor:** 7/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

---

#### Mechanic 2: Clan System & Social Raids
Join or create a clan. Donate troops, participate in Clan Wars, compete on clan leaderboards. **Social accountability** is the stickiest mechanic in mobile gaming.

**TEM Adaptation: Plastering Crews — Guild System**
> Players form their own plastering companies. Company leaderboard: total Satoshis earned, jobs completed, highest suburb reputation. Clan War equivalent: "Job Tender Wars" — two companies compete to finish a large commercial job first. Company members can donate power tools to each other. Company chat with preset speech bubble reactions (Matt's angry face, Connie's approval nod, Jose's chill thumbs up). Top companies get featured on an in-game "Industry Leaders" board.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Hard  
- **Fun Factor:** 9/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 8/10

---

#### Mechanic 3: Loot & Resource Management
Gold, elixir, dark elixir — three currencies with different uses. Managing them creates **strategic depth** without complexity. You always want more of something.

**TEM Adaptation: Three-Resource Economy**
> **Satoshis** (BTC — main premium currency), **Plaster Mix** (craft resource — needed for jobs, produced over time from depot), and **Reputation Points** (earned from client ratings — unlocks premium suburb access). You always feel slightly short on one of the three. Plaster Mix can be traded between crew members. Satoshi earnings have a daily cap unless you upgrade your "Quote Book" (depot upgrade).

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 7/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

---

#### Mechanic 4: Hero Characters with Cooldowns
Heroes are powerful units that go down after use and need recovery time. This creates **strategic use tension** — do I burn my hero now or save them?

**TEM Adaptation: Star Player System**
> Each crew member has a "Star Player" ability with a cooldown. Jose's "Zen Mode" — slows everything down for 10 seconds (TrowelingGame slow-mo). Tsuyoshi's "Mohawk Surge" — sprints the scaffold climb in ScaffoldGame. Matt's "Boss Rush" — doubles job payout but you must finish in half the time. Once used, they need a cooldown (coffee break!) before they're ready again. Coffee/bladder mechanic feeds into hero cooldown recovery — give them a coffee break and recover faster.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 9/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

---

#### Mechanic 5: Season Pass / Battle Pass
Supercell launched a gold pass seasonal structure — pay a small amount, unlock better rewards from a tiered track over the season. Hugely profitable, feels fair.

**TEM Adaptation: TEM Season Pass — "The Quote Book"**
> Monthly "Quote Book" subscription. Free tier: standard jobs, daily Connie briefing, basic van skins. Premium tier: priority job notifications, double Satoshi weekends, exclusive suburb access (Brighton mansions, Southbank penthouses), special character outfits, and a monthly voice message from Matt himself congratulating you. Priced low enough to feel like a no-brainer for engaged players.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium

## 🔫 GAME 4: PUBG Mobile
**Genre:** Battle Royale | **Publisher:** Tencent / Krafton  
**Key Stats:** 300M monthly players, $2.6B+ lifetime revenue, 1B+ downloads

### Why It's Addictive

#### Mechanic 1: Shrinking Safe Zone / Forced Urgency
The play zone shrinks over time, forcing players toward each other. **Artificial urgency** escalates tension in every single match regardless of skill.

**TEM Adaptation: End-of-Day Job Rush**
> "Clock-Out Crunch" — a timed mode where the day is ending but a rush job comes in. The time window shrinks rapidly. Connie calls: *"I know it's late but the client is paying TRIPLE, we can't say no."* Jobs stack up faster than you can complete them. The shrinking window creates the exact same urgency as a PUBG circle. Fail to finish within the window = no pay. Finish everything = massive Satoshi jackpot.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Easy  
- **Fun Factor:** 9/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

---

#### Mechanic 2: Loot Drops & Rare Item Scarcity
Care packages with rare loot drop randomly on the map. Everyone rushes toward them, creating high-risk, high-reward moments. **Risk vs. reward tension** is addictive.

**TEM Adaptation: "Arvo Special" Job Drops**
> Random golden job requests appear on the Melbourne map — limited to the first van that reaches them. High-paying, exotic jobs: "Penthouse in Southbank — $50K worth of Satoshis, 20-minute window." Multiple players converge on the same marker creating competition. Voice from Mikayla: *"Hot job just dropped — better move!"* The van that reaches it first claims it. Creates emergent competition in the open world.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Hard  
- **Fun Factor:** 10/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

---

#### Mechanic 3: Spectator Mode / Death Review
When you're eliminated, you can spectate the player who killed you. Teaches strategy, extends session time past death, and reduces frustration. **Zero dead time**.

**TEM Adaptation: Client Cam / Job Replay**
> After failing a job (botched troweling, scaffold fall, van crash), instead of a hard game-over screen, you watch a short replay from the "client's perspective" — a funny animated reaction where the client stares in horror at the mess. Jarrad or Fabio appears in a speech bubble offering a roast: *"Mate, my nan could plaster better than that."* Then a quick tip appears before the retry button. Turns failure into entertainment rather than pure frustration.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 8/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

---

#### Mechanic 4: Ranking System / Seasonal Rank Decay
PUBG has a tiered rank (Bronze → Conqueror). Ranks decay if you don't play, creating **return urgency**. Top rank is a major identity status symbol.

**TEM Adaptation: Plastering Licence Tier System**
> Apprentice → Qualified Plasterer → Licensed Tradesman → Master Plasterer → TEM Legend. Rank is based on job completion rate, Satoshi earnings, and star ratings. Rank decays slightly each week — you must stay active to maintain it. Top-ranked players get their name on the in-game "Wall of Fame" at the TEM depot. Matt gives personalised voice lines for each rank milestone: *"You're officially a weapon. TEM Legend. That's it."*

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 8/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

---

#### Mechanic 5: Loadout / Pre-Game Customisation
Players set up their loadout (weapons, attachments, gear) before or between matches. **Anticipation and preparation** between sessions keeps engagement high.

**TEM Adaptation: Pre-Job Van Loadout Screen**
> Before each job, you load the van: choose which crew members come (max 3), which power tools to bring, which radio station to play (buffs mood/speed of different characters), and whether to bring a coffee thermos (delays bladder interrupt). The loadout screen is quick but creates genuine strategic choice. Tsuyoshi hates country music — bring country radio and he works slower. Fabio loves 80s rock — brings 80s radio and he gets a speed boost.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 9/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

## 👑 GAME 5: Royal Match
**Genre:** Puzzle with Meta-Layer | **Publisher:** Dream Games  
**Key Stats:** Consistently #1 or #2 top-grossing in US App Store 2024–2025, overtook Candy Crush in several markets

### Why It's Addictive

#### Mechanic 1: Puzzle + Narrative Meta-Layer (Castle Restoration)
Every level you complete restores a room in a castle. The puzzle is just the means — **the narrative restoration is the real reward**. Players invest emotionally in the build progression, not the puzzle itself.

**TEM Adaptation: Melbourne Heritage Restoration Arc**
> The TEM crew gets contracted to restore a grand old Melbourne heritage building (think Royal Exhibition Building or a Federation-era pub). Each completed job adds a visible, beautifully rendered section to the restoration — plaster a room, watch the crumbling wall come to life. The building slowly transforms from wreck to masterpiece over dozens of sessions. A narrative plays out: who owns the building? A mystery client? Could it be… Connie's secret project? Drip-feed story beats to keep players invested.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Hard  
- **Fun Factor:** 9/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

---

#### Mechanic 2: Boosters That Build Pre-Level Anticipation
Before each level, Royal Match shows you available boosters. Even if you don't use them, **seeing the tools available** creates confidence and optimism — reducing pre-play anxiety.

**TEM Adaptation: Pre-Job Crew Confidence Screen**
> Before each job, display a simple "Crew Confidence" screen: a cartoon version of the assigned crew members with speech bubbles showing their current mood/power. Jose: *"Chill, got this."* (confidence high). Tsuyoshi: *"Let's smash it"* (speed boost active). Matt: *"Don't you dare stuff this up"* (pressure mode — higher reward, higher difficulty). The screen is fast but gives players a moment of anticipation before diving in — and communicates status in a fun, character-driven way.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Easy  
- **Fun Factor:** 8/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

---

#### Mechanic 3: Royal Pass — "King Robert" Narrative Character
Royal Match features King Robert, a recurring character whose story unfolds across the castle restoration. He reacts, celebrates, and occasionally fails alongside the player. **Character parasocial bond** keeps players emotionally attached.

**TEM Adaptation: Matt as the Recurring Narrative Anchor**
> Matt (the boss) becomes the through-line character whose personality, backstory, and reactions evolve as you progress. He starts gruff and suspicious of the player. As you earn Satoshis and reputation, he warms up. Unlock his backstory: why is the BTC goal so important to him? What's he building toward? Each major milestone triggers a new Matt cutscene. Players who've played for months feel like they actually know Matt. A genuine parasocial investment in a tradie character — unprecedented in mobile gaming.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Medium  
- **Fun Factor:** 9/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

---

#### Mechanic 4: "Hard Level" Pacing (Designed Difficulty Spikes)
Royal Match deliberately inserts extra-hard levels every 5–10 levels. These spike frustration enough to trigger booster purchases, but not enough to cause quit. **Precision-calibrated difficulty** is a monetisation science.

**TEM Adaptation: "Nightmare Job" Difficulty Spike**
> Every 8–10 jobs, a Nightmare Job appears — flagged by Mikayla with a panicked speech bubble: *"This client is… special."* The job has multiple difficulty modifiers stacked (time pressure + difficult trowel surface + spill risk + broken scaffold). These jobs are hard but learnable. Fail them twice = a special "Site Supervisor Mode" unlocks where Connie walks you through a slightly easier version. First-time completion of a Nightmare Job earns a special achievement badge.

- **Difficulty to Build:** Easy  
- **Fun Factor:** 8/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 9/10

---

#### Mechanic 5: Team Events / Social Chest
Players join temporary teams (3-5 people) to hit a group milestone together. Success earns everyone a chest. **Cooperative social pressure** in a short burst — not as demanding as a full clan, just enough to feel connected.

**TEM Adaptation: Weekend Crew Rush Event**
> Friday–Sunday: a special large commercial contract appears (stadium, school, hospital wing). It's too big for one crew — multiple players contribute their completed jobs toward the same building. Progress bar fills collectively. When the building hits 100%, everyone who contributed gets a reward chest (Satoshis + exclusive cosmetics). Matt sends a crew-wide speech bubble: *"That's what I call a team. Shouting the arvo off."*

- **Difficulty to Build:** Hard  
- **Fun Factor:** 9/10  
- **TEM Theme Fit:** 10/10

## 🏆 TOP 5 RECOMMENDATIONS

*Ranked by combined score of Fun Factor × TEM Fit × Build Feasibility*

---

### 🥇 #1 — Pre-Job Van Loadout Screen
**Source:** PUBG Mobile — Loadout/Pre-Game Customisation  
**Build Difficulty:** Medium | **Fun:** 9/10 | **TEM Fit:** 10/10

This is the single highest-impact feature TEM could add with the most organic fit to the game's existing systems. Before every job, players spend 30 seconds at the loadout screen: select 3 crew members (each with a unique perk), choose a power tool to bring, pick a radio station (which affects crew mood and stats), and decide whether to pack the thermos (delays the bladder interrupt mid-job). This transforms every job from a passive assignment into a strategic choice the player owns. The character roster — Jose, Tsuyoshi, Jarrad, Fabio, Phil, Joe — finally become mechanically distinct and worth caring about, not just cosmetic faces. Radio station buffs (80s rock for Fabio = speed boost; country for anyone but Tsuyoshi = debuff) create genuinely funny emergent comedy. It costs relatively little to build since all assets already exist — it's a UI wrapper around character stat data — but delivers enormous feel-good engagement. This is the feature that would make TEM feel like a fully realised game.

---

### 🥈 #2 — Matt as Narrative Anchor (Character Arc)
**Source:** Royal Match — King Robert Parasocial Bond  
**Build Difficulty:** Medium | **Fun:** 9/10 | **TEM Fit:** 10/10

Matt is already the emotional centre of TEM — gruff boss, high standards, occasional humanity. Making him the explicit narrative backbone of the game transforms it from a minigame collection into a story players are emotionally invested in. As players accumulate Satoshis toward the BTC goal, Matt's character arc unfolds in short cutscene vignettes — written with care and real Australian tradie authenticity. Why does Matt want the BTC so badly? Is he paying off a debt? Buying out the company? Planning to retire and hand it to the crew? Each reveal deepens investment. Connie, Mikayla, and the crew react to the unfolding story. This is the difference between a game people play and a game people talk about. The writing cost is low; the emotional return is immense. Australian players, in particular, will find a character like Matt — no-nonsense, hardworking, occasionally vulnerable — deeply relatable and worth sticking around for.

---

### 🥉 #3 — Clock-Out Crunch (Shrinking Job Window)
**Source:** PUBG Mobile — Shrinking Safe Zone  
**Build Difficulty:** Easy | **Fun:** 9/10 | **TEM Fit:** 9/10

The simplest and most immediately fun addition on this list — a standalone timed mode that can be built fast and iterated quickly. The day is ending. Connie calls with a last-minute stack of jobs. The time window shrinks relentlessly. Each job you complete adds Satoshis, but you must decide: do you rush to finish this one or abandon it and sprint to the next? The emergent tension of the PUBG circle — created here purely through a timer and stacked objectives — is perfectly suited to the TEM work ethic narrative. It also creates a mode that's fundamentally different to normal job flow, adding much-needed variety. Build it as a weekly event first, then promote it to a permanent daily challenge if it hits. Requires no new assets — just a new job sequencing mode with a shrinking timer overlay and Connie's frantic call as the trigger. Voice line pitch: *"I know you're knackered, but the client is paying triple and I said we'd be there in 20 minutes."*

---

### 🏅 #4 — Melbourne Heritage Restoration Meta-Arc
**Source:** Royal Match — Castle Restoration Narrative Meta-Layer  
**Build Difficulty:** Hard | **Fun:** 9/10 | **TEM Fit:** 10/10

The most ambitious feature on the list — and the one with the highest long-term retention impact. Players aren't just doing disconnected jobs; they're slowly restoring a beloved Melbourne heritage building. The building is rendered in beautiful detail, and every session adds a visible, tangible section: a freshly plastered ceiling here, a restored Victorian cornice there. This is the meta-layer that transforms a minigame collection into a game with a soul. The heritage building should be iconic — the Royal Exhibition Building, a Federation-era hotel, a grand terrace in Fitzroy — something Melbourne players feel pride in. The restoration arc doubles as the narrative spine: who hired TEM for this job? What's hidden in the walls? Is Connie involved? Drip-feeding mystery alongside the build keeps players theorising and talking. Yes, it's the hardest feature to build — but it's the one that would define TEM's long-term identity and justify extended play sessions. Build the framework for one building first; the system is reusable for future content.

---

### 🏅 #5 — Weekend Crew Rush Event
**Source:** Royal Match — Team Events / Social Chest  
**Build Difficulty:** Hard | **Fun:** 9/10 | **TEM Fit:** 10/10

The social hook TEM needs to grow beyond solo play without the full complexity of a clan system. Friday to Sunday, a monster commercial contract appears — too big for any single crew. Players contribute completed jobs (each job adds a small amount to the global bar). When the bar fills, everyone who contributed gets a prize chest. This is cooperative without being demanding — you contribute what you naturally would anyway, just with collective purpose attached. The TEM theme makes this sing: the job is something culturally resonant (a school in the western suburbs, a Melbourne stadium, a new café strip in Footscray). Matt sends a crew-wide message announcing the job. When it completes, he sends another: a genuine thank-you with a single human moment. The social chest contains cosmetics unavailable any other way — building FOMO that drives participation every weekend. Start with mock leaderboard data to make it feel populated even at early player counts; fill in real social infrastructure as the playerbase grows.

## 🔑 KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Character mechanics have the highest TEM alignment** — the crew roster is TEM's unique asset. Any mechanic that makes Jose, Tsuyoshi, Fabio, Matt etc. feel distinct and worth caring about pays double dividends.

2. **Easy wins first** — Clock-Out Crunch, Star Ratings, Connie's Daily Briefing, and the Pre-Job Confidence Screen are all low-effort, high-reward. Ship these fast to boost engagement while harder features bake.

3. **The BTC/Satoshi goal needs a narrative** — Matt's arc gives players a reason to care about the number going up. Without it, currency is abstract. With it, every Satoshi feels like a step toward something real.

4. **Melbourne specificity is TEM's superpower** — Royal Match works because players feel attached to the castle. TEM should lean into Melbourne identity hard: iconic suburbs, real cultural events (AFL, Melbourne Cup, Laneway Festival), recognisable architecture. Players who know Melbourne will love it.

5. **Social but light** — Weekend Crew Rush is the right social depth for TEM's audience: cooperative without the time commitment of a full clan system. Tradies don't have time for raid schedules.
